CA-Assignment
Suppose that the following processes arrive for execution at the times indicated. Each process will run for the amount of time listed. In answering the questions, use non preemptive scheduling, and base all decisions on the information you have at the time the decision must be made. 
Process Arrival Time Burst Time 
P1 0.0 8 
P2 0.4 4 
P3 1.0 1 
a. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the FCFS scheduling algorithm? 
b. What is the average turnaround time for these processes with the SJF scheduling algorithm?
